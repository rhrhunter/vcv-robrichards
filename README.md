Current supported interfaces:

## Installation Steps

Since these are not distributable on the VCV plug-in library, you'll have to compile
from source and install locally into your Rack Installation. To do this, you'll need to download
the most recent version of the [Rack SDK](https://vcvrack.com/downloads/Rack-SDK-1.1.6.zip), unzip it to some directory (e.g. ~/Rack-SDK), and run the following:

`RACK_SDK=/path/to/Rack-SDK make install`

Then launch Rack.
